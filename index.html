                        A squat is a seemingly simple movement, but can cause injury if done incorrectly. All
                        levels of fitness can be improved by supporting squat form. This program has been created to
                        identify an individual’s squat form and provide feedback on imperfections of the squat. The
                        program is designed to check the angle of thigh to calf to ensure full muscle activation. In
                        addition, the program would monitor the heel of the individual to recognize any sign of
                        imbalance. In summary this program will give binary, yes or no, feedback; either, approving or
                        disapproving an individual’s squat form.

                       IEX Cloud is an online stock indexing company that offers API's for stock analysis. This is a demo on
                        how to pull stock prices by name and list them in an updating chart. The included example is in Vuejs
                        and a react example can be found in the repository.

                        This was a game developed with Andre, Troy, and Max. The game was a simple 
                        math game that was multiple choice and the player dodged trees if guessing correctly.
                        This was a great experience seeing what it is like working with a team on a large project
                        and working out the complexities of collaboration. My contribution was designing algorithms 
                        that autonomously create math questions and available answers. This algorithm was designed to 
                        scale with difficulty and saves memory by replacing a hard-coded dictionary of questions and answers.

                        The peg sorting game uses a branch search algorithm from Algorithms and Data Structures. It demonstrates

                        My implementation of this problem illustrates the difference between using Java’s 
                        notify() solution vs. condition variables solution. This problem helps illustrate 
                        some potential synchronization issues when designing concurrent algorithms
